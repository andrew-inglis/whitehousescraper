Scrape petition data from petitions.whitehouse.gov

This python script will scrape data from a petition at https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/ i.e., grab name, city, state, date and signature number from the ajax-loaded html when a specific petition URL is given.

Road map:

1) python scraper in shell

2) process text into a CSV file

3) GUI front end to allow use by the average end user
